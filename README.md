# How to download your Transferwise CSV files

You want to download one CSV file for each of your balances.   To do this:
1) Click on "Balances" in the left hand navigation
2) Click on the account you wish to download transactions for, for instance "GBP"
3) Click on the "More" button, bottom right and click on "Download a statement"

Note that this does not work for the CSV file downloaded from the History section.
